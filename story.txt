period 1
period 2
period 3
I dreaded this class. On one side of the coin I had Will Hartig in my class, my favorite student. On the other side I had 
Morgan Feller in my class. Morgan Feller is my least favorite student. He is terrible. Morgan always puts his bag in a chair 
rather than putting it on the floor like all the other kids. WHO DOES THAT? The floor is there for a reason. Kids need to sit 
in those chairs every once in a while. Now some poor kid has to sit down on where Morgan's disgusting backpack sat for 50 
minutes. But at the end if the period I felt much better because of how hard Will worked and how much he deserves extra credit
period 4
